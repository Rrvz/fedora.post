I am a totally noob, but in my case I use terminal TERMINATOR and I modified the eve-ng-integration file located at /usr/bin/eve-ng-integration to open the device in tabs instead of a new window for everyone.
Probably there is a better way to do it, but here you are the "--new-tab" argument added to make it works.
Under definition of method _terminal_emulator_cmd(self) modify the line

    return ['x-terminal-emulator', '--new-tab','-e']

does not work in gnome terminal


sudo dnf install xdotool wmctrl


for PORT in $(seq 2001 2010); do
    gnome-terminal -e telnet localhost $PORT &
    gnome-terminal -e telnet lab01.refidomsa.com.do $PORT &
    telnet lab01.refidomsa.com.do 33025
