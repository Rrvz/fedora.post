do a fzf lookup buffer inside vim

#5 do a lookup function to look and match and move the entire line, and if a line is repeated insert a (x quantities of them))

check if there are dates repeated and duplicate the first ones

cat ocr | awk '{ print $1 }'
i
If 11 characters positions match the other 11 position then


awk '//{ print $1, $2 }' swap|less

awk '{print $0}' FILE

# field 1 is equal to field 2
awk '{print $1 == $2}' swap

# state your problem
if field #1 is not equal to field #2 then
    then
        make a insertion in filed #1 with the value of field #2
        then moved entire line to the matched field


# with python

import sys

f = sys.stdin
# If you need to open a file instead:
f = open('swap')
for line in f:
    fields = line.strip().split()
    # Array indices start at 0 unlike AWK
    print(fields[0])



os.system("awk '{print $2}' swap")


f = open('swap')
for line in f:
    fields = line.strip().split()
# Array indices start at 0 unlike AWK
    if (fields[0] == fields[1]):
        print(fields[0])
else:
    print('not the same')

if field A = B
    conftinue looking the other line
        else
        cut the matching fild with the rest of the  line and paste
        to the line matching it.
